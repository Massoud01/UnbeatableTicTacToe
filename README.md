# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

This project features an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI that employs two different algorithms to make optimal moves. The AI opponent utilizes the Minimax algorithm for the initial implementation and later incorporates reinforcement learning for further improvement.

## Algorithms

### 1. Minimax Algorithm
   - The AI evaluates possible future game states to determine the move that maximizes its chance of winning.
   - This algorithm ensures that the AI makes optimal decisions by considering all possible outcomes of each move.
## How to Play

To engage with the AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. In your terminal run, python TicTacToe.py
3. Make your moves on the Tic Tac Toe board as 'O.'
4. Witness the AI's optimal moves as 'X.'
5. Track wins, losses, and draws between you and the AI.
6. Explore the chosen move by the AI and the algorithm responsible for its selection.

Enjoy playing against the unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI!
